## 1. Problem Statement
  The problem is that traditional methods of accessing ambulance services during medical emergencies can be slow and inefficient, leading to a lack of transparency and anxiety   for patients and their loved ones. Our challenge is to create an innovative app that streamlines the process of requesting an ambulance, providing real-time location           tracking   and estimated arrival times, to improve the efficiency and transparency of ambulance services.


## 2. Abstract
   The ambulance service system is a crucial aspect of emergency medical care. However, traditional methods of accessing ambulance services, such as calling the emergency l      hotline or flagging down an ambulance on the street, can be inefficient and time-consuming, leading to delays in receiving critical medical care. To address this issue, we     propose the development of an ambulance service app that streamlines the process of requesting an ambulance while providing users with more transparency and control over       the ambulance service they receive.
